# Numerous engineering and scientific applications require finding solutions to a set of equations. Ex: 8x + 7y = 38 and 3x - 5y = -1 have a solution x = 3, y = 2. Given integer coefficients (a, b, c, d, e, and f) of two linear equations with variables x and y listed below, use brute force to find an integer solution for x and y in the range -10 to 10.

# ax + by = c

# dx + ey = f

# Ex: If the input is:

# 8
# 7
# 38
# 3
# -5
# -1
# Then the output is:

# x = 3 , y = 2
# Use this brute force approach:

# For every value of x from -10 to 10
#    For every value of y from -10 to 10
#       Check if the current x and y satisfy both equations. If so, output the solution, and finish.
# Ex: If no solution is found, output:

# There is no solution
# Assume the two input equations have no more than one solution.

# Note: Elegant mathematical techniques exist to solve such linear equations. However, for other kinds of equations or situations, brute force can be handy.

# Read in first equation, ax + by = c
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

# Read in second equation, dx + ey = f
d = int(input())
e = int(input())
f = int(input())

found = False  # flag to track if a solution is found

for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        if (a * x + b * y == c) and (d * x + e * y == f):
            print(f'x = {x} , y = {y}')
            found = True
            break  # exit inner loop once solution found
    if found:
        break  # exit outer loop as well

if not found:
    print("There is no solution")
